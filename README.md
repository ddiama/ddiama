# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dimitra

I am an aerospace engineer working at the intersection of simulation, modeling, and data-driven analysis â€” mostly in the context of propulsion systems and system-level design.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been building and working with tools that help connect performance modeling with other aspects of complex systems, like structural constraints, operational needs, or technology variability.

I occasionally use this space to explore small projects, test out methods, or revisit concepts I find interesting â€” sometimes engineering-focused, sometimes more analytical.

### Things I enjoy working on:
- Modeling dynamic systems using Python, NPSS, or Modelica  
- Design-space exploration and trade studies  
- Playing with data, uncertainty, or reliability concepts  
- Looking at where design meets operations

Right now, I am experimenting a bit with open datasets related to system health and reliability. If you have worked on something similar or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.
